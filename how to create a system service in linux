create a script file with the following lines - 

#!/bin/sh

       #eg nohup java -jar $PATH_TO_JAR /tmp 2>> /dev/null >> /dev/null &
                   echo $! > $PID_PATH_NAME

 esac
 
 
 test the script 
 
 sh script_name.sh start
 sh script_name.sh stop
 sh script_name.sh restart
 
 do cd /etc/systemd/system
 
create a file with the following format

touch <service_name>.service
eg : touch hari.service  #a service with name hari will be created

do vi hari.service and add the following lines

[Unit]
 Description = Java Service
 After network.target = Service_Name.service
[Service]
 User=root(or any other user name u want to run the process with)
 Type = forking
 Restart=always
 RestartSec=1
 SuccessExitStatus=143 
 ExecStart = /usr/local/bin/Service_Name.sh start 
 ExecStop = /usr/local/bin/Service_Name.sh stop
 ExecReload = /usr/local/bin/Service_Name.sh reload
[Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target
 
 
 save the file
 
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable Service_Name
sudo systemctl start  Service_Name
sudo systemctl stop   Service_Name
